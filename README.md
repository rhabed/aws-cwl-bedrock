# What are CloudWatch Logs?

CloudWatch Logs is a service that records and monitors log data generated by applications and systems running on AWS. It is a valuable tool for troubleshooting issues, monitoring performance, and understanding the behavior of your applications.

# Why is it difficult to understand CloudWatch Logs?

CloudWatch Logs can be difficult to understand because:

It generates a large amount of data.
The data can be difficult to interpret.
How can generative AI be used to summarize CloudWatch log data?

# Generative AI can be used to summarize CloudWatch log data by:

Identifying patterns and trends in the data.
Summarizing the data in a human-readable format.

# Steps to implement this solution:

Collect CloudWatch log data.
Process the data.
Train a generative AI model.
Use the model to summarize the data.

# Implementation
Using Terraform and Python

# Deployment
- Access to AWS
- Enable Anthropic Model (in this case, us-east-1 as model not available in ap-southeast-2)
- Update the backend s3 in provider.tf
- Deploy
  - `terreform validate`
  - `terraform plan`
    - `terrform apply -var region=us-east-1`
- Create a Wdiget in Cloudwatch dashboards. (terraform module in the making)
